# Walk a Directory Tree

## Overview

The `walk_a_directory_tree.py` script is a Python utility designed to traverse through a specified directory and its subdirectories, printing out the structure and contents. It's a flexible tool that can be easily customized to perform specific actions on each folder and file encountered during the traversal.

## Features

- **Recursive Directory Traversal:** The script walks through all files and subdirectories within a given directory.
- **Customizable Actions:** Placeholder sections are provided where you can add your own code to perform actions on files or directories as needed.
- **Command-Line Interface:** The script accepts a directory path as a command-line argument, making it easy to run from the terminal.

## Usage

### Command-Line Execution

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python walk_a_directory_tree.py <path>
```

- `<path>`: Replace this with the path to the directory you want to traverse.

### Example

```bash
python walk_a_directory_tree.py /Users/username/Documents
```

This command will output the structure of the `/Users/username/Documents` directory, listing all subfolders and files within it.

### Script Output

When you run the script, it will print:

- The name of each folder it encounters.
- The names of subfolders within each folder.
- The names of files within each folder.

The output will look something like this:

```
The current folder is: /Users/username/Documents
SUBFOLDER OF /Users/username/Documents: Projects
SUBFOLDER OF /Users/username/Documents: Notes
FILE INSIDE /Users/username/Documents: file1.txt
FILE INSIDE /Users/username/Documents: file2.pdf

The current folder is: /Users/username/Documents/Projects
FILE INSIDE /Users/username/Documents/Projects: project1.py
FILE INSIDE /Users/username/Documents/Projects: project2.py
```

### Customization

The script is designed to be easily extendable. You can add your own functions within the provided placeholders to perform tasks like:

- Counting files of a specific type.
- Renaming or moving files based on certain criteria.
- Extracting or processing information from files.

Simply replace the placeholder comments with your custom code.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x** is required to run this script.

## Error Handling

- The script checks if the provided path is a valid directory. If the path is invalid, an error message will be displayed, and the script will exit.
