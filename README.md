# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Exercises and Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** project repository! This repository is dedicated to implementing and organizing exercises and projects from the book **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"** by Al Sweigart. Each chapter's exercises and projects are housed in their respective branches, making it easy to navigate and explore the solutions for each part of the book.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured with branches named according to the chapters in the book. Each branch contains the exercises and projects specific to that chapter. The naming convention for the branches is as follows:

- `chX/chapter-name`

Where:
